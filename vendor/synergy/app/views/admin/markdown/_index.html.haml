  # # Big title
  ## ## Medium title
  ### ### Small title

  * `*italic*` => *italic*

  * `[link](http://example.com)` => [link](http://example.com)
  * `![image](http://image.jpg)` => displays the image in the URL
  * `<email@example.com>` – <email@example.com> (a link to a mail address)

  Lists
  --------

  Bulleted list (`*` transforms into • ):

      * this
      * is a
      * bulleted
      * list

  Numbered list:

      1. this
      2. is a
      3. numbered
      4. list

  Paragraphs
  ----------

  You separate paragraphs with an empty new line:

      This is one paragraph.

      This is another paragraph.

  To make a line break (without making a new paragraph), use `<br>`:

      This is one line<br>
      Which I wanted to break.

  Quotations
  ----------

  In order to make a quotation, put a ">" in the beginning of the paragraph:

      > The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.

  And you get some quotation-looking text:

  > The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.
