# Base Style

This project was heavily inspired by
[inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css). Included modules:

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
- [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- [ColorMeSass](https://github.com/silvenon/color-me-sass) ([original](https://github.com/RichardBray/ColorMeSASS))

Work in progress...
